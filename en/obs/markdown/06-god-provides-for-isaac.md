When Abraham was very old and his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man,
Abraham sent one of his servants back to the land where his relatives
lived to find a wife for his son, Isaac.

After a very long journey, God led the servant to Rebekah, who was the
granddaughter of Abraham’s brother.

Rebekah agreed to leave her family and go back with the servant. Isaac
married her as soon as she arrived.

After a long time, Abraham died and all of the promises that God had
made to him in the covenant were passed on to Isaac. God had promised
that Isaac would have countless descendants, but Isaac’s wife, Rebekah,
could not have children.

Isaac prayed for Rebekah, and God allowed her to get pregnant with
twins. While they were still inside her, the two children struggled with
each other, so Rebekah asked God what was happening.

God told Rebekah, “There are two nations inside of you. They will
struggle with each other and the older son will serve the younger one.”

When Rebekah's babies were born, the older son came out red and hairy,
and they named him Esau. Then the younger son came out holding on to
Esau's heel, and they named him Jacob.
