After Jesus was crucified, the unbelieving Jewish leaders said to
Pilate, “That liar, Jesus, said he would rise from the dead after three
days. The tomb must be guarded so that his disciples do not steal the
body and then say he has risen from the dead.”

Pilate said, “Make the tomb as secure as you can.” So they sealed the
stone at the entrance of the tomb and put soldiers there to make sure no
one could steal the body.

The day after Jesus was buried was a Sabbath, a day of rest. Very early
on the morning after the Sabbath, several women went to Jesus’ tomb to
put more burial spices on his body.

There was a great earthquake. An angel of the Lord appeared from heaven,
as bright as lightning. He rolled away the stone that was covering the
entrance to the tomb and sat on it. The soldiers guarding the tomb were
terrified and fell to the ground like dead men.

The angel told the women, “Do not be afraid. Jesus is not here. He has
risen from the dead, just like he said he would! Look in the tomb and
see.” The women looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus had been lying.
His body was not there!

Then the angel told the women, “Tell the disciples that Jesus has risen
from the dead and is going before you into Galilee.”

The women were full of fear and great joy. They ran to tell the
disciples the good news.

On the way, Jesus appeared to them, and they worshiped him. Jesus said,
“Do not be afraid. Go and tell my disciples that I will see them in
Galilee.”
