=====================

Abram and Sarai waited over twenty years, but they still had no son. God
spoke to Abram and promised again that he would have a son and as many
descendants as the stars in the sky. Abram believed God’s promise.

Then Abram’s wife said to him, “Since the LORD has not allowed me to
have children and now I am too old to have children, here is my servant,
Hagar. Marry her also so she can have a child for me.”

So Abram married Hagar. Hagar had a baby boy, and Abram named him
Ishmael. Abram wanted God to bless Ishmael. God said, “I will bless him,
but Ishmael is not the son of promise. I will not make my covenant with
him.”

“Your wife, Sarai, will have a son—he will be the son of promise. Name
him Isaac. My covenant will be with him, and he will become a great
nation.” Then God changed Abram’s name to Abraham, which means “father
of many.” God also changed Sarai’s name to Sarah, which means
“princess.”

Finally, when Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90, Sarah gave
birth to Abraham’s son. They named him Isaac as God had told them to do.

When Isaac was a young man, God tested Abraham’s faith by saying, “Take
Isaac, your only son, and kill him as a sacrifice to me.” Again Abraham
obeyed what God told him to do.

He tied up his son Isaac and laid him on an altar. He was about to kill
his son when God said, “Stop! Do not hurt the boy! Now I know that you
fear me because you did not keep your only son from me.”

Nearby Abraham saw a ram which was stuck in a bush. God had provided the
ram to be the sacrifice instead of Isaac. Abraham happily offered the
ram as a sacrifice.

Then God said to Abraham, “Because you were willing to give me
everything, even your only son, I promise to bless you. Your descendants
will be more than the stars in the sky. Because you have obeyed me, all
the families of the world will be blessed through your family.”
