At last it was time for the Israelites to enter the Promised Land.
Joshua sent two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho. It was protected
by strong walls. A prostitute named Rahab protected the spies and helped
them escape because she believed God. They promised to protect Rahab and
her family when Jericho was destroyed.

To enter into the Promised Land, the Israelites had to cross the Jordan
River. God told Joshua, “Have the priests go first.” When the priests’
feet touched the Jordan River, the water stopped flowing so the
Israelites could cross over on dry ground.

After the people crossed the Jordan River, God told Joshua how to attack
the powerful city of Jericho. The people obeyed God. The soldiers and
priests marched around the city of Jericho once a day for six days.

On the seventh day, they marched around the city seven times. On the
last time around the city, the soldiers shouted while the priests blew
on their trumpets.

And the walls around the city fell down! The Israelites destroyed
everything in the city as God had commanded. Only Rahab and her family
were saved. They became part of the Israelites. When the rest of the
Canaanites heard about what had happened to Jericho they were terrified.

The Canaanite tribe of Gibeon lied to Joshua and said they were from far
away. They asked Joshua to make peace with them. God had commanded the
Israelites not to make peace with any Canaanites, but Joshua and the
Israelites did not ask God where the Gibeonites were from. So Joshua
made peace with them.

When the other Canaanites heard that the Gibeonites had made peace with
the Israelites, they joined their armies and attacked Gibeon. The
Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua asking for help.

![obs-15-08.jpg](/_media/en/obs/obs-15-08.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=f3fa4e "obs-15-08.jpg")

Joshua was angry that he had been tricked, but he gathered the Israelite
army, and they marched all night to reach the Gibeonites. In the early
morning they surprised their Canaanite enemies and attacked them.

God threw the Canaanites into confusion. God fought for Israel that day
by sending large hailstones that killed many of the Canaanites.

![obs-15-10.jpg](/_media/en/obs/obs-15-10.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=cbdae0 "obs-15-10.jpg")

God also made the sun stand still in the sky so that Israel could finish
defeating the Canaanites. God won a great victory for Israel that day.

![obs-15-11.jpg](/_media/en/obs/obs-15-11.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=3cc11c "obs-15-11.jpg")

After this defeat, the rest of the Canaanites who were left gathered
together to attack Israel. Joshua and the Israelites attacked and
destroyed them.

![obs-15-12.jpg](/_media/en/obs/obs-15-12.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=40ea29 "obs-15-12.jpg")

After this battle, God gave each tribe of Israel their own section of
the Promised Land. Then God gave Israel peace along all its borders.

![obs-15-13.jpg](/_media/en/obs/obs-15-13.jpg?w=640&h=360&tok=278a73 "obs-15-13.jpg")

When Joshua was an old man, he called all the people of Israel together.
Then Joshua renewed the covenant that God had made with the Israelites
at Sinai. The people promised to remain faithful to God and follow his
laws.
