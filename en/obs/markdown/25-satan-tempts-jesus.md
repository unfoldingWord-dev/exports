Immediately after Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit led him out into
the desert, where he fasted for forty days and forty nights. During that
time he was tempted by Satan.

Satan said, “If you are the Son of God, turn these rocks into bread so
you can eat!”

Jesus replied, “It is written in God’s Word, ‘Man does not live only on
bread, but on every word that God speaks!’”

Then Satan took Jesus to the highest point on the Temple and said, “If
you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will
command His angels to catch you so your foot does not hit the ground.’”

But Jesus replied, “It is also written in God’s Word, ‘Do not test
God.’”

Then Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and all their
glory and said, “I will give you all this if you bow down and worship
me.”

Jesus replied, “Get away from me, Satan! It is written in God’s Word,
‘Worship only the Lord your God.’”

Then Satan left him to wait for a better time. Angels came and took care
of Jesus.
