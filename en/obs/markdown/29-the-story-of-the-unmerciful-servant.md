One day Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, how many times should I forgive my
brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?” Jesus said, “Not
seven times, but seventy times seven!” By this, Jesus meant that we
should always forgive. Jesus told this story.

“The Kingdom of God is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with
his servants. One of his servants owed a huge debt worth 200,000 years’
wages.”

“Since the servant could not repay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this
man and his family as slaves to make payment on his debt.’”

“The servant fell on his knees before the king and said, ‘Please be
patient with me, and I will pay everything back.’ The king felt pity for
the servant and canceled all of his debt.”

“The servant went out and found another servant who owed him a debt
worth four months’ wages. The servant choked the man and said, ‘Pay me
what you owe me!’”

“The man fell on his knees and said, ‘Please be patient with me, and I
will pay everything back.’ But the servant refused and threw the man in
prison until he could pay the debt.”

“Some other servants saw what had happened and were greatly disturbed.
They went to the king and told him everything.”

“The king called the servant and said, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave
your debt because you begged me. You should have done the same.’ In his
anger the king threw the wicked servant into prison until he paid back
all of his debt.”

Then Jesus said, “This is what my heavenly Father will do to every one
of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”
