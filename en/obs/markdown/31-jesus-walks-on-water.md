Then Jesus told the disciples to get into a boat and sail to the other
side of the lake while he dismissed the crowd. After Jesus had sent the
crowd away, he went up on a mountain to pray. Jesus was there all alone,
and he prayed long into the evening.

Meanwhile, the disciples’ boat was a long way from land. They were in
danger, because a storm had come up and the boat was being tossed around
by the waves and the wind.

Jesus decided to go to them, so he walked on top of the water across the
lake toward the boat!

The disciples were very afraid when they saw Jesus, because they thought
they were seeing a ghost. Jesus knew that they were afraid, so he called
out to them and said, “Do not be afraid. It is I!”

Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you
on the water.” Jesus told Peter, “Come!”

So, Peter got out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the
surface of the water. But after a short distance, he turned his eyes
away from Jesus and began to look at the strong wind and waves.

Then Peter became afraid and began to sink. He cried out, “Lord, save
me!” Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to
Peter, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”

When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped.
The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, “Truly,
you are the Son of God.”
