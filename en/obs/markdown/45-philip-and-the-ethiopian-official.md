One day, an angel of the Lord told Philip, one of Jesus’ disciples, to
go to the desert on the road to Gaza. As he walked along the road,
Philip saw an important official from Ethiopia sitting in his chariot.
The Holy Spirit told Philip to go up and talk to this man.

When he came near the chariot, he heard the man reading from the prophet
Isaiah, “He was led like a lamb to be killed, and did not say a word. He
was treated unfairly and without respect. His life was taken away from
him.”

Philip asked the Ethiopian, “Do you understand what you are reading?” He
said, “No. Is Isaiah talking about himself or someone else?”

Philip showed him that Isaiah was talking about Jesus. Philip also used
many other Scriptures to tell him the Good News of Jesus.

As they passed by some water, the Ethiopian said, “Look! There is some
water! Why can’t I be baptized?” And he ordered the chariot to stop.

So they went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. After Philip
baptized the Ethiopian, the Holy Spirit carried Philip away to another
place where he continued telling people about Jesus.

The Ethiopian went on his way, happy to know Jesus.
