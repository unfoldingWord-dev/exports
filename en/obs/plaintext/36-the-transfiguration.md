36. The Transfiguration
=======================

One day, Jesus took three of his disciples, Peter, James, and John with
him. (This John was not the same person who baptized Jesus.) They went
up on a high mountain by themselves.

All of a sudden, Jesus’ face became as bright as the sun and his clothes
became as white as light, whiter than anyone on earth could make them.

Then Moses and Elijah, who had both lived hundreds of years earlier,
appeared. They talked with Jesus about his death which would soon happen
in Jerusalem.

As Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus, Peter said, “Jesus, it is
good for us to be here. Let us make three tents, one for you, one for
Moses, and one for Elijah.” Peter did not know what he was saying.

As Peter was talking, a bright cloud came down on top of them and a
voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son whom I love. I am pleased
with him. Listen to him.” The three disciples were terrified and fell on
the ground.

Then Jesus touched them and said, “Do not be afraid. Get up.” When they
looked around they saw no one but Jesus.

As Jesus and the three disciples went back down the mountain, Jesus said
to them, “Do not tell anyone about what happened here until after I have
been raised from the dead.”
