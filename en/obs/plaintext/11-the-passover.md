11. The Passover
================

God warned Pharaoh that if he did not let the Israelites go, then He
would kill all the firstborn males of both people and animals. When
Pharaoh heard this he still refused to believe God.

God provided a way to save the firstborn of anyone who believed in Him.
Each family had to choose a perfect lamb or goat and kill it.

Then they needed to put some of its blood around the door of their
house. They were to roast the meat and eat it as a feast, along with
bread that was made without yeast. They were to be ready to leave Egypt
when they ate.

The Israelites did everything just as God had commanded them. That night
the angel of God went throughout Egypt killing every firstborn son.

All the houses of the Israelites had blood around the doors, so the
angel of God passed over those houses and everybody inside was safe.
They were saved because of the lamb’s blood.

But the Egyptians did not believe God or obey His commands. So the angel
of God did not pass over their houses. The angel of God killed every
firstborn son in Egypt.

From the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh,
every firstborn died. There was much weeping in Egypt.

Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Take the Israelites and
leave Egypt immediately!” The Egyptians encouraged the Israelites to
leave right away.
