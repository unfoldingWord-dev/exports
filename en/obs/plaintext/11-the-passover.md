11. The Passover
================

God warned Pharaoh that if he did not let the Israelites go, then he
would kill all the firstborn males of both people and animals. When
Pharaoh heard this he still refused to believe God.

God provided a way to save the firstborn of anyone who believed in him.
Each family had to choose a perfect lamb or goat and kill it.

Then the Israelites needed to put some of its blood around the door of
their house. They were to roast the meat and eat it quickly, along with
bread that was made without yeast. They were to be ready to leave Egypt
when they ate.

The Israelites did everything just as God had commanded them. In the
middle of the night, God went throughout Egypt killing every firstborn
son.

All the houses of the Israelites had blood around the doors, so God
passed over those houses and everyone inside was safe. They were saved
because of the lamb’s blood.

But the Egyptians did not believe God or obey his commands. So God did
not pass over their houses. God killed every one of the Egyptians'
firstborn sons and every firstborn of their animals as well.

Every Egyptian firstborn male died, from the firstborn of the prisoner
in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh. There was much weeping in Egypt.

That same night, Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Take the
Israelites and leave Egypt immediately!” The Egyptian people also urged
the Israelites to leave right away.
