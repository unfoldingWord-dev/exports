46. Paul Becomes a Christian
============================

Stephen was a leader in the early Church. He had a good reputation and
was full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom. Stephen did many miracles and
argued strongly that people should believe in Jesus.

One day, Stephen was arguing with some Jews about Jesus. They became
very angry and lied about Stephen, saying, “We heard him speak evil
things about Moses and God!” So they arrested Stephen and brought him
before the high priest and leaders of the Jews.

The high priest asked Stephen, “Are these things true?” Stephen replied,
“You stubborn and rebellious people always reject the Holy Spirit, just
as your ancestors always rejected God and killed His prophets. You have
even killed the Messiah whom God sent!”

When the people heard this, they covered their ears and yelled loudly.
They threw Stephen out of the city and stoned him to death.

As he was dying Stephen cried out, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” Then
he fell to his knees and cried out again, “Lord, do not count this sin
against them.” Then he died.

A man named Saul approved of Stephen’s execution and guarded the
belongings of those who stoned Stephen. That day many people attacked
the Christians, and they were scattered through that region.

Saul continued to attack the Christians going from house to house,
arresting men and women, and putting them in prison. Saul received
permission from the high priest to go to the city of Damascus to arrest
Christians there and bring them back to Jerusalem.

As Saul was on his way to Damascus, Jesus appeared to him in a bright
light and said, “Saul! Why do you persecute me?” He said, “Who are you,
Master?” Jesus replied, “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.”

When Saul got up, he could not see and had to be led into Damascus. Saul
ate and drank nothing for three days.

Then God appeared to a Christian named Ananias and said, “Go to the
house where Saul is staying. Lay your hands on him so that he can see
again. I have chosen him to declare My name to the unsaved. I will show
him how much he must suffer for My sake.” So Ananias prayed for Saul,
and he regained his sight.

Immediately, Saul was baptized and began preaching to the Jews, saying,
“Jesus is the Son of God!” The Jews were amazed that the man who had
tried to destroy the Christians was now a Christian. Saul argued with
the Jews, proving that Jesus was the Messiah. Saul became known as Paul.

After many days, the Jews made a plan to kill Paul. They placed people
at the city gates to kill him. But Paul heard about the plan, and his
friends helped him escape. One night they lowered him over the city wall
in a basket. Paul ran away and continued preaching about Jesus.
