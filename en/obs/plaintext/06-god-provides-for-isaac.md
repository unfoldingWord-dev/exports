6. God Provides for Isaac
=========================

When Abraham had grown to be very old and Isaac was a man, Abraham sent
one of his servants back to the land where his relatives lived to find a
wife for his son, Isaac.

After a very long journey, God led the servant to Rebekah, who was the
granddaughter of Abraham’s brother.

She agreed to leave her family and go back with the servant. Isaac
married her as soon as she arrived.

After a long time, Abraham died and all of the promises that God had
made to him in the covenant were passed on to Isaac. But Isaac’s wife,
Rebekah, could not have children. Isaac could not be the father of many
nations if he did not even have a son.

Isaac prayed for Rebekah, and God allowed her to get pregnant with
twins.

Before they were born, God told Rebekah that the older son would serve
the younger one.

When they were born, the older son came out red and hairy—they named him
Esau. The younger son had smooth skin, and they named him Jacob.
