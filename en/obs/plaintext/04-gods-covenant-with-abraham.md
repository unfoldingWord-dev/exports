4. God’s Covenant with Abraham
==============================

Many years after the flood, there were again many people in the world,
and they all spoke the same language. But the people did not obey God.
Instead of having children and filling the earth, they gathered together
and built a city.

They were very proud, and they did not care about what God said. They
even began building a tall tower to reach heaven. God saw that if they
all kept working together, they could do many evil things.

So He changed their language into many different languages and spread
the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was
called Babel, which means “confused.”

Hundreds of years later, God spoke to a man named Abram. God told him,
“Leave your country and family and go to the land I will show you. I
will bless you and make you a great nation. I will make your name great.
I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All
families on earth will be blessed because of you.”

So Abram obeyed. He took his wife, Sarai, and all his servants and herds
of animals and went to the land God showed him, the land of Canaan.

When Abram arrived in Canaan God said, “Look all around you. All the
land that you can see I will give to you and your descendants as an
inheritance. I will bless you and make your name great.” Then Abram
settled in the land.

One day, Abram met Melchizedek, the priest of God Most High. Melchizedek
blessed Abram and said, “May God Most High who owns heaven and earth
bless Abram.” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all he owned.

Abram and Sarai waited over twenty years, but they still had no son. God
spoke to Abram and promised again that he would have a son and as many
descendants as the stars in the sky. Abram believed God’s promise. God
said that Abram was righteous through believing in God's promise.

Then God made a covenant with Abram. A covenant is an agreement between
two parties. God said, “I will give you a son from your own body. To
your descendants I give the land of Canaan.” But Abram still had no son.
